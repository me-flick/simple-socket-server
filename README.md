## Simple Python Socket Server

A simple socket server, and client, written in Python. 

This project uses socket concepts, to transfer basic encoded Unicode characters across a local network, to (eventually) chat! This was created to practice Python coding while implementing networking basics.

<em> IDE used: PyCharm.</em>

**TBD:**

- Add more functionality to transmit chat across the network, while keeping the connection open. 
- Fix code to allow server and client to be used on public internet.
- Eventually, this project will be deployed in a full environment, within my network. 
- Screenshots of the functional project will be added to this README.
